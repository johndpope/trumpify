# Trumpify
### Make your words be the BEST WORDS.

The President usually set the standard in fashion for the next few years. And no fashion statement of the Trump presidency has been more present than the way he talks (and most importantly tweets).

Trumpify is here to help you imitate his style. (WIP)

Using NLP Trumpify notices the intent and different entities in your sentences and adds insults or praise as it needs. It also finds any words that may be too complicated and makes them, well... More Trump.

For example:

```
The New York Times keeps spreading inaccurate information. 
The media truly is the adversary of my administration.
```

Turns into:

```
The outragious New York Times keeps spreading wrong information. 
The media truly is the adversary of my presidential term. 
SO NOT GOOD!
```

As you can imagine this is perfect for tweeting! ;)

It's still pretty buggy, but I think with a bit more work, we can make Tweeting Great Again

## Considering

This perhaps could be integrated into a Chrome Extension that trumpifies your entries into text fields
